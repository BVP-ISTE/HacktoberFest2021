/*Given a Boolean 2D matrix (0-based index), find whether there is a path from (0,0) to (x,y)
and if there is one path, print the minimum no of steps needed to reach it, else print -1
if the destination is not reachable. Moves are possible in only four directions i.e. up, 
down, left and right. The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is 1.*/
